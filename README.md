## Hi there 👋

My name is Juuso, I'm currently doing my master's in Tuni, focusing on information security but have a background in software development.

- I'm currently developing my skills and bettering my understanding in front-end and the integration of LLMs

- Most of my projects have been school projects, where I have done various tasks from UI-desing to server-side logic.
